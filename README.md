# DSA-210-Project - Correlating FGM/C Prevalence with Religious Demographics

# Introduction 
Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) is a crime that has been ongoing in 2025, affecting millions of women worldwide. While this practice is mostly driven by social norms, it is also associated with specific religious factors. This project  investigates into the statistical relationship between the prevalence of FGM/C in various countries and their corresponding religious influences while controlling for socio-economic and demographic factors such as education, income level, and urbanization.

# Motivation
Even the existence of FGM/C is a significant human rights issue.Effective policy and intervention strategies to eradicate it depend on a correct understanding of its root causes. The motivation for this project is to apply the data science pipeline to a complex social problem.

# Data Sources and Collection
To build a robust analysis, there will be various datasets from multiple organizations.

* UNICEF â€“ FGM Data / Country Profiles:       National FGM prevalence (%), disaggregated by age, region, and education level
* DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys):     Micro-level data on FGM experience, religion, education, and socio-economic variables
